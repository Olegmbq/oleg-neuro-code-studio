# 🌐 Oleg & Neuro Code Studio — Website / Manifesto

## Concept & Structure (Draft)

This document captures the **website sketch for Code Studio**.  
It is not final copy and not code — it defines **direction, tone, and structure**.

---

## 🎯 Page Goal

Calmly and honestly answer the questions:

- who we are
- how we think
- why we work this way
- what products we create

Without marketing noise.  
Without loud promises.  
Without pressure.

---

## 🧠 Overall Tone

- calm
- confident
- craft-driven
- human

Not “we are the best”, but:

> “This is how we work.  
> If it resonates — you are home.”

---

## 🏠 Page Structure

### 1️⃣ Hero / Intro (top of the page)

Minimum text. One idea.

**Content:**

- studio name
- a short phrase about the approach

**Direction example (not final copy):**

> Digital products, built with care and structure.  
> Calm foundations for long-term work.

---

### 2️⃣ Manifesto (the heart of the page)

Short paragraphs.  
No long walls of text.

**Block ideas:**

- we build for years
- we take responsibility for what we release
- structure matters more than trends
- the user is not left alone

👉 Short version: [MANIFESTO.md](/MANIFESTO.md)

---

### 3️⃣ How We Work

A very simple list.

**Principles:**

- think first
- structure before speed
- release only when ready
- support matters

---

### 4️⃣ Products

A minimal block, no showcase.

**Now:**

- Starter Kit v0.1
- status: released
- link to GitHub

**Later:**

- Starter Kit v0.2
- other core packages

---

### 5️⃣ Closing / Footer

A quiet ending to the page.

**Idea:**

> If something doesn’t work out — you’re not alone.  
> We’re here.

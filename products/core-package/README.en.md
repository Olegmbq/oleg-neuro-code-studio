# ⚙️ Oleg & Neuro — Starter Kit (v0.1)

## Core Package · Business Engine

Starter Kit is a minimal yet thoughtfully designed project foundation by  
**Oleg & Neuro Code Studio**.

It is created as a **starting point** — clear structure, essential documents,  
and a calm, focused beginning without chaos.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Create a new project from the template:

```bash
cd products/core-package/scripts

bash create-project.sh my-new-project

```

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

- `templates/` — a set of project templates (base, vite-react)

- `scripts/` — project generation from the template

- `docs/` — usage, support, roadmap

- `welcome.md` — our approach and entry point

## ✅ Who This Is For

- beginners who need a clear and calm start

- developers who value structure and order

- teams and individuals building products for the long run

## ❌ Who This Is NOT For

- if you expect a “magic button” and instant results

- if you don’t want documentation or structure

- if you need a ready-made React / Vite project right now
  (this is planned for v0.2)

## 🧭 Where to Start

- Welcome — welcome.md

- How to use — docs/usage.md

- Support — docs/support.md

## 🧠 Our Principle

We build calmly, systematically, and for the long term.
If something doesn’t work — you are not alone. We are here.

## 📖 Manifesto

Full Code Studio manifesto (RU):
[MANIFESTO-FULL.md](../../MANIFESTO-FULL.md)

## 📌 Note:

Detailed documentation (usage, support, roadmap)
is currently available in Russian.
English versions are planned.

---

## 🚀 Starter Kit v0.2

Starter Kit v0.2 introduces a **real project generator** with working templates.

### What’s new

- fully functional **Vite + React** template
- project generation with a single command
- ready-to-run development server

### Example usage

```bash
cd products/core-package/scripts
bash create-project.sh my-app vite-react

cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev

```

The project starts immediately in the browser.
